# Deploying-and-Managing-Microservices-in-a-Cloud-Native-Environment

Objective:
Learn how to:
 Set up and configure a Kubernetes cluster
 Containerize and deploy a microservices application
 Manage Kubernetes deployments, services, autoscaling, and persistent 
storage

1. Kubernetes Setup
   We have installed and used Kubernetes locally to deploy and manage our containerized application.

2. Containerization and Docker

We built a sample microservices application consisting of services like watch, upload, nginx, and a MySQL database. For each service, we created separate Dockerfiles, built individual Docker images, and pushed them to Docker Hub for containerized deployment.

The Docker images successfully pushed to Docker Hub and is now available for deployment from the container registry.
